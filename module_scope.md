The behavior of module scope in Node.js (and other module systems) is *consciously designed* and is *not* a bug. It's a 
fundamental feature that provides several crucial benefits for code organization, maintainability, and preventing 
conflicts.

Here's why module scope is essential and what problems it solves:

* **Namespace Management:** Without module scope, all your code would exist in a single global namespace. This would 
  lead to a high risk of naming collisions. If two different libraries or parts of your code used the same variable name
  (e.g., `name`, `count`, `user`), they would interfere with each other, causing unpredictable behavior and bugs. Module
  scope creates separate namespaces for each module (file), preventing these collisions.
* **Encapsulation (Information Hiding):** Module scope allows you to encapsulate (hide) variables, functions, and 
  classes within a module. This means that they are only accessible within that module and are not exposed to other 
  modules unless you explicitly choose to export them. Encapsulation is a key principle of good software design. It 
  helps to:
   * Reduce complexity: You don't have to worry about the internal workings of one module affecting another.
   * Improve maintainability: You can change the internal implementation of a module without breaking other modules that
     rely on it (as long as the module's interface—its exports—remains consistent).
   * Enhance security: You can prevent other modules from accidentally or maliciously accessing or modifying internal 
     data.
* **Code Organization and Reusability:** Modules promote code organization by allowing you to break down your 
  application into smaller, logical units. This makes your code easier to understand, navigate, and maintain. Modules 
  also encourage code reuse. You can create a module containing a set of utility functions or components and then import
  and use that module in multiple other modules.
* **Dependency Management:** Module systems make it easier to manage dependencies between different parts of your code 
  or between your code and external libraries. You can explicitly declare which modules your module depends on, and the
  module system will ensure that those dependencies are loaded correctly.

### Why the Browser's Global Scope is Different (and Problematic)

The browser's global scope (the `window` object) is a historical artifact. Early JavaScript didn't have a module system,
so everything was thrown into the global scope. This has led to many problems over the years, including:

* **Naming collisions:** As mentioned earlier, this is a major issue with the global scope.
* **Security vulnerabilities:** Any script on a webpage can access and modify any other script's variables in the global
  scope, creating security risks.
* **Code organization challenges:** Managing large JavaScript applications with everything in the global scope becomes
  incredibly difficult.

Modern JavaScript development in browsers now heavily relies on module systems (like ES modules) to address these 
problems.

**Example and Explanation of Scope and `this` in Node.js:**

```javascript
// Node.js example

var globalVar = "I'm a global var (using var)"; // Does not attached to global
let blockScopedVar = "I'm block scoped (using let)"; // NOT attached to global
const globalConst = "I'm a global constant (using const)"; // NOT attached to global

global.name = "Node Global Name"; // Setting a property on the global object

const obj = {
  name: "Alice", // This is local to the object
  greet: () => {
    // Accessing the global object's name property
    console.log("1=>Hello, " + global.name); // Output: 1=>Hello, Node Global Name

    // 'this' is NOT the global object inside an arrow function. It's the module scope.
    console.log("2=>Hello, " + this.name);   // Output: 2=>Hello, undefined
  },
};

obj.greet();

console.log(`3=>${global.globalVar}`); // Output: 3=>undefined
console.log(`4=>${globalVar}`); // Output: 4=>I'm a global var (using var)
console.log(`5=>${blockScopedVar}`); // Output: 5=>I'm block scoped (using let)
console.log(`6=>${globalConst}`); // Output: 6=>I'm a global constant (using const)
console.log(`7=>${name}`); // Output: 7=>Node Global Name
```
Output
```shell
$ node test.js
1=>Hello, Node Global Name
2=>Hello, undefined
3=>undefined
4=>I'm a global var (using var)
5=>I'm block scoped (using let)
6=>I'm a global constant (using const)
7=>Node Global Name
```

**Explanation:**

* `global.name = "Node Global Name";`: This correctly sets the `name` property on the global object.
* `console.log("1=>Hello, " + global.name);`: This correctly accesses the `name` property of the global object.
* `console.log("2=>Hello, " + this.name);`: Arrow functions don't have their own this context; they inherit it from the 
  surrounding scope(lexical scope). At the global level, `this` is not the same as `global` in Node.js, so `this.name`
  is `undefined`.
* `console.log("3=>${global.globalVar});`: Variables declared with `var` at the module level are not automatically 
  attached to the global object in Node.js. That's why `global.globalVar` is `undefined`. 
* `console.log("4=>${globalVar});`: `globalVar` is scoped to the module (because of `var`), not the `global` object.
  However, in the REPL, it is attached to the global object.
* `console.log("5=>${blockScopedVar});`: `blockScopedVar` is scoped to the module (because of `let`), not the `global` 
  object.
* `console.log("6=>${globalConst});`: `globalConst` is scoped to the module (because of `const`), not the `global` 
  object.
* `console.log(7=>${name});`: `name` is declared using `let` at the top level of the module, so it is scoped to the
  module, but it is a separate variable from the `name` property of `obj`. It is not attached to the global object.

BUT IF I USE REPEL
```shell
$ node
Welcome to Node.js v20.15.1.
Type ".help" for more information.
> // Node.js example
undefined
> 
> var globalVar = "I'm a global var (using var)"; // Attached to global
undefined
> let blockScopedVar = "I'm block scoped (using let)"; // NOT attached to global
undefined
> const globalConst = "I'm a global constant (using const)"; // NOT attached to global
undefined
> 
> global.name = "Node Global Name"; // Setting a property on the global object
'Node Global Name'
> const obj = {
...   name: "Alice", // This is local to the object
...   greet: () => {
...     // Accessing the global object's name property
...     console.log("1=>Hello, " + global.name); // Output: 1=>Hello, Node Global Name
... 
...     // 'this' is NOT the global object inside an arrow function. It's the module scope.
...     console.log("2=>Hello, " + this.name);   // Output: 2=>Hello, undefined
...   },
... };
undefined
> obj.greet();
1=>Hello, Node Global Name
2=>Hello, Node Global Name
undefined
> console.log(`3=>${global.globalVar}`); // Output: 3=>undefined
3=>I'm a global var (using var)
undefined
> console.log(`4=>${blockScopedVar}`); // Output: 4=>I'm block scoped (using let)
4=>I'm block scoped (using let)
undefined
> console.log(`5=>${globalConst}`); // Output: 5=>I'm a global constant (using const)
5=>I'm a global constant (using const)
undefined
> console.log(`6=>${name}`); // Output: 6=>Node Global Name
6=>Node Global Name
undefined
> 
```

**In summary:**

* Module scope is a deliberate and essential feature of modern JavaScript (and other programming languages). It's not a 
  bug; it's a crucial mechanism for building maintainable, scalable, and robust applications. It is what allows us to
  create complex JavaScript applications without chaos.
* Arrow functions in Node.js inherit `this` from the module scope, not the global object. But in the REPL, `this` 
  refers to the global object. If it's parent scope is a module, `this` will refer to the module scope.
* `var` declarations at the top level of a Node.js module *do not* attach to the global object. But in REPL, they are 
  attached to the global object.
* `let` and `const` declarations at the top level of a Node.js module are scoped to the module and *do not* attach to 
  the global object.
