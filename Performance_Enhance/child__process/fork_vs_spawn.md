## Node.js `fork()` vs. `spawn()`

Both `fork()` and `spawn()` are functions in the `child_process` module in Node.js that allow you to create child 
processes. However, they serve different purposes and have key distinctions in how they operate.

**1. Purpose and Use Cases:**

*   **`spawn()`:**  Primarily used for executing **non-Node.js** executables or commands. It's a general-purpose way to run any system command as a separate process. You'd use `spawn()` to run things like `ls`, `git`, `python`, or any other program available on the system.
*   **`fork()`:** Specifically designed to create **new Node.js processes**. It spawns a new instance of the Node.js runtime and executes a specified JavaScript file in that new instance. This is useful for creating worker processes to handle computationally intensive tasks or to isolate parts of your application.

**2. Process Creation Mechanism:**

*   **`spawn()`:**  Uses the system's native process creation mechanism. On Unix-like systems, it typically uses `fork` followed by `exec` (or `posix_spawn` for better performance in some cases). On Windows, it uses `CreateProcess`.
*   **`fork()`:**  Creates a new V8 JavaScript engine instance along with the new process. This means each forked process runs in its own isolated JavaScript environment. Because of that, this will be slower at scale, more CPU and RAM intensive, and not the best option for very short lived processes.

**3. Communication:**

*   **`spawn()`:** Communicates with the child process through streams (`stdin`, `stdout`, `stderr`).  You have to manually manage the data flowing through these streams.
*   **`fork()`:**  Automatically creates an IPC (Inter-Process Communication) channel between the parent and child processes using `process.send()` and `process.on('message')`. This makes it easier to send and receive messages and data between the processes.

**4. Sharing Resources:**

*   **`spawn()`:** Does not share memory with the parent process by default. Data is passed through streams.
*   **`fork()`:** Because each process has its own V8 engine instance, Node.js by default has no memory sharing between processes.

**5. Performance and Overhead:**

*   **`spawn()`:** Generally has lower overhead for starting processes, especially when running non-Node.js executables.  It doesn't need to initialize a new JavaScript runtime.
*   **`fork()`:**  Has higher overhead because it needs to create a new V8 engine instance. Fork should be best use for long running services that require multi threading or core delegation to other processes.

**6. Code Example:**

**`spawn()` Example (Running `ls` command):**

```javascript
const {spawn} = require('child_process');

const ls = spawn('ls', ['-l', '/tmp']);

ls.stdout.on('data', (data) => {
    console.log(`stdout: ${data}`);
});

ls.stderr.on('data', (data) => {
    console.error(`stderr: ${data}`);
});

ls.on('close', (code) => {
    console.log(`child process exited with code ${code}`);
});
```

**`fork()` Example (Running a separate Node.js file):**

```javascript
// parent.js
const {fork} = require('child_process');

const child = fork('child.js');

child.on('message', (message) => {
    console.log('Message from child:', message);
});

child.send({hello: 'world'});
```

```javascript
// child.js
process.on('message', (message) => {
  console.log('Message from parent:', message);
  process.send({ received: 'message' });
});
```

**7. When to Use Which:**

*   **Use `spawn()` when:**
    *   You need to execute an external command or application (e.g., image processing, video encoding, shell scripts).
    *   You need to stream data to or from an external process.
    *   You're not running Node.js code in the child process.
    *   Performance overhead of process creation is a concern.
*   **Use `fork()` when:**
    *   You need to create worker processes to handle CPU-intensive tasks in Node.js.
    *   You want to isolate parts of your Node.js application into separate processes.
    *   You need a simple and reliable way to communicate between parent and child Node.js processes using messages.
    *   You need processes to be able to act on the same data, or use the same database, but prevent one from writing at the same time as another.
