# Scaling
- Node.js clustering for multi-core use.
- Load Balancing: Utilize a reverse proxy like Nginx or HAProxy in front of Node.js instances.
- Horizontal scaling: Add additional Node.js instances behind the load balancer.
- Vertical scaling: Provide more powerful resources (CPU, RAM) to individual instances.
